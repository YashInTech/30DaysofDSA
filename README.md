This repository documents my 30-day journey of mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It includes solutions to 100+ problems in Java, covering topics like Arrays, Strings, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, and DP. Problems are organized by topic, with daily commits to track progress and consistency.
